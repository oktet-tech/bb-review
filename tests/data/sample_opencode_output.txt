I've analyzed the code change. Here are my findings:

### Issue: Unused variable declaration
- **File:** `src/main.c`
- **Line:** 12
- **Severity:** low
- **Type:** style
- **Comment:** The variable 'x' is declared and assigned but its value is only printed once. This could be simplified.
- **Suggestion:** Consider inlining the value directly in the printf call.

### Issue: Missing error handling
- **File:** `src/utils.c`
- **Line:** 8
- **Severity:** medium
- **Type:** bugs
- **Comment:** The add function doesn't validate its inputs. Integer overflow is possible with large values.
- **Suggestion:** Add overflow checks or use a wider integer type.

### Issue: General code organization concern
- **Severity:** low
- **Type:** architecture
- **Comment:** The helper_function doesn't have a clear purpose from the code. Consider adding documentation.

## Summary

Overall, the code change is acceptable but has a few minor issues that should be addressed:
- Clean up unused variables
- Add input validation for arithmetic operations
- Improve documentation
